## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is your ticket to predicting used car prices with flair! Using a robust dataset, we:
- Clean and preprocess data like pros
- Craft stunning visualizations to reveal trends
- Train a linear regression model to predict prices
- Evaluate performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
- Empower you to predict prices for new cars with a single click

Get ready to explore the world of used cars through data-driven lenses! 🚘

## 📊 Dataset
The star of the show is `used_car_price_dataset_extended.csv`, a treasure trove of 10,000 used car records. Here's what you'll find inside:
- `make_year`: The year the car rolled off the assembly line
- `mileage_kmpl`: Fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter
- `engine_cc`: Engine size in cubic centimeters
- `fuel_type`: Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric)
- `owner_count`: Number of previous owners
- `price_usd`: Selling price in USD
- `brand`: The car’s manufacturer
- `transmission`: Manual or Automatic
- `color`: The car’s exterior color
- `service_history`: Service record status (Full, Partial, Unreported)
- `accidents_reported`: Number of reported accidents
- `insurance_valid`: Insurance status (Yes, No)

*Note*: Missing `service_history` values were stylishly filled with "Unreported" to keep the data sleek and complete.
